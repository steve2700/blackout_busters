## Current Services (10)

The active service list, consistent across the header nav, homepage grid, and `/services` page:

1. Air Conditioning Services
2. Refrigeration Repairs
3. Cold Room Installation and Repair
4. Commercial Refrigeration
5. Appliance Repairs
6. HVAC Maintenance Contracts
7. Emergency Callout Service
8. Plumbing Services (appliance and refrigeration related)
9. Electrical Services (appliance and refrigeration related)
10. Maintenance Contracts (`/property-maintenance`)

---

## Service Areas (11)

Each area has its own page at `/service-areas/[suburb]`, rendered via `ServiceAreaTemplate`:

Pretoria, Johannesburg, Midrand, Sandton, Centurion, Fourways, Randburg, Bedfordview, Rosebank, Roodepoort, Morningside.

Every area page uses a distinct `introImage` so the pages stay visually unique. The default image (`/cold-fix-technicians-servicing-air-conditioner.png`) is only used as a fallback when no `introImage` prop is passed.

---

## URL Structure

- Service pages: `/service-name` (e.g. `/refrigeration-repairs`)
- Service areas: `/service-areas/[suburb]` (e.g. `/service-areas/sandton`)

---

## SEO Files

- **`app/sitemap.ts`** — generates `/sitemap.xml`. Includes the homepage, core pages, all 10 service pages, and all 11 service areas. Update it whenever a page is added or removed.
- **`public/robots.txt`** — points crawlers to the sitemap at `https://www.coldfix.co.za/sitemap.xml`.
- **`public/llms.txt`** — plain language summary of the business, services, and service areas for LLM consumption. Keep it in sync with the live service and area lists.
- **`app/layout.tsx`** — global metadata, Open Graph/Twitter tags, and Organization + LocalBusiness JSON-LD.

---

## Known TODOs

- [ ] **Search verification codes** — placeholder values (e.g. `your-google-verification-code`) still in `layout.tsx` metadata.
- [ ] **Unconfirmed stats** — figures such as "100s of clients served" and "10+ years experience" carried through the templates should be confirmed as accurate.
- [ ] **`safari-pinned-tab.svg`** — placeholder silhouette, not a true vector trace of the real logo. Replace if you want pixel perfect accuracy.

---

## Notes for Future Edits

- The **`ServicePageTemplate`** and **`ServiceAreaTemplate`** components in `components/` are shared wrappers. Editing them affects *every* service page or every service area page at once, so check there first before assuming a bug is page specific.
- When adding or removing a service, update it in **all** of these places: `components/header.tsx`, `components/footer.tsx`, `components/home/services-overview.tsx`, `app/services/page.tsx`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `public/llms.txt`, and any `relatedServices` arrays on individual service pages that might link to it.
- When adding or removing a service area, update `app/service-areas/` (the page), the service areas hub, `components/home/service-areas-preview.tsx`, `app/sitemap.ts`, and `public/llms.txt`.
- Contact details (phone `+27 70 309 6749`, WhatsApp `wa.me/27703096749`, email `info@coldfix.co.za`) appear across the header, footer, and home components. Change all of them together.
- Bulk find and replace across the repo works well from Git Bash:
  ```bash
  find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" \) -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
    -exec sed -i 's/OLD_VALUE/NEW_VALUE/g' {} +
  ```
  Always `grep -r` first to preview matches before running the replace.
